# chessDictionaryValidator.py
Create a validator that checks whether or not a dictionary of chess pieces and their tile placements adhere to the rules of chess. 

My approach:
1. Create all the standards of a chess board using dictionaries and lists(tileNames, piecesNames with specifics)
2. Compare a test dictionary to the standards that i created, if they don't match up or if theres too many number of pieces or not enough, return false

Things that need improvement:
1. I didn't solve the problem before hand which brings up a lot of trial and errors. Many new variables and loops created to force the program to run, this leads to sloppy code, missed opurtunities to increase code speed, and unsuspecting issues that create a whole new set of problems to fix
2. I don't know how far to validate, bc I didn't map out my code first, i forced code into the solution. I was unsure whether to add more validations. If i mapped everything out, there would be a direct goal to head towards and then i could tweak or improve the structure
3. Not following the prompt completely. Bc of this, i was getting lost into the problem, and by the end, i wasn't sure the prompt task was completed.
